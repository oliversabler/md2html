# MD2HTML 
This is a simple CLI application that parses a Markdown file and converts it to a HTML file.

This is not a serious project and was created for personal use. But still, if you see 
anything that can be improved, feel free to contribute or create an issue.

## Installation
To install, run `cargo build --release` and then execute `./md2html` from the */target/release/* folder.

If you prefer, you can bind the path to an alias to run it from other folders.
